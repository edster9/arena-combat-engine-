# Vision: Arena Combat Engine

## The Core Concept

**"A virtual tabletop that came to life."**

This is not a realistic racing simulator. This is not an arcade shooter. This is the experience of playing a tactical vehicular combat game with friends - but the miniatures move on their own, physics determines outcomes, and the explosions are real.

## Visual Identity

### The VTT Aesthetic

The visual style evokes the feel of a premium virtual tabletop - clean, readable, and tactically focused, but with the depth and immersion of 3D physics.

**Key direction:**
- Technical illustration quality - detailed but stylized
- Industrial arena aesthetic - not grimdark, not cartoony
- Grid is visible but integrated (painted lines, not glowing overlay)
- UI uses clean modern design with tactical information density

Elements:
- **Vehicles** have bold colors for team identification with visible wear
- **The Arena** feels industrial and purpose-built
- **Physics** is real - vehicles skid, roll, and tumble
- **Information** is always readable and actionable

### The 3D Reality

But this tabletop has come alive:

- Vehicles have **real physics** - they skid, roll, tumble when hit hard
- **Fire and smoke** billow from damaged cars
- **Metal deforms**, paint scratches, wheels blow out
- **Shadows and lighting** give depth and drama
- When a car explodes, debris scatters across the arena

### The Balance

```
NOT THIS:                          THIS:
----------------                   ----------------
Hyper-realistic                    Stylized but solid
Photo-real cars                    Miniature/model feel
Cluttered HUD                      Clean tactical display
Generic apocalypse                 Distinctive arena sport
```

## Color Palette

| Element | Feel |
|---------|------|
| **Arena floor** | Concrete grey, worn asphalt, oil stains |
| **Arena walls** | Industrial - corrugated metal, concrete barriers |
| **Vehicles** | Bold team colors with weathering |
| **Fire/Explosions** | Orange-yellow, reads clearly against grey |
| **UI elements** | Clean dark panels, accent colors for actions |
| **Grid lines** | Subtle - painted lines or scored concrete |

## Audio Direction (Planned)

- **Engine sounds** that feel mechanical, not synthetic
- **Weapons** with punch - machine guns rattle, rockets whoosh then boom
- **Metal impacts** - crashes should feel heavy
- **Ambient** - arena crowd murmur, announcer echoes
- **Music** - industrial, driving, builds tension during turns

---

## Gameplay Feel

### Turn-Based Tension

The game should create moments of:
- **Anticipation** - "Will my drift clear that corner?"
- **Surprise** - Physics creates unexpected outcomes
- **Mastery** - Better scripts and timing = better results
- **Drama** - Narrow escapes and spectacular crashes

### Tactical Depth

Players think about:
- Vehicle positioning and facing
- Speed management (faster = more dangerous)
- Maneuver selection and timing
- Script tuning for their playstyle
- Risk vs reward on aggressive moves

## What We're Building

- A turn-based vehicular combat game
- Physics-based movement execution
- Player-programmable vehicle control
- Strategic depth with emergent outcomes
- Multiplayer arena competition

## What We're NOT Building

- A Twisted Metal clone (arcade action)
- A Crossout clone (F2P MMO grind)
- A realistic driving simulator
- A mobile casual game
- A battle royale

---

## Success Criteria

The design succeeds if:

1. A new player understands it's a tactical game, not a twitch shooter
2. Physics creates memorable emergent moments
3. The scripting system rewards skill and experimentation
4. Watching a car crash feels satisfying every time
5. The aesthetic is distinctive and professional

## Open Questions

- [ ] Arena style: Indoor arena vs. outdoor lot vs. both?
- [ ] UI: Fully diegetic (part of game world) vs. traditional overlay?
- [ ] Vehicle customization visuals: Paint, decals, damage wear?
- [ ] Spectator mode for multiplayer matches?
